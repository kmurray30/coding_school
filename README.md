# Coding School

A hands-on, exercise-driven approach to learning programming. No lectures, no grading, just code.

## Structure

Each course contains units, and each unit contains exercises:

```
course1/
├── unit1_output_basics/
│   ├── exercise1_hello.py
│   ├── exercise2_syntax.py
│   └── quiz.yaml
├── unit2_types_strings/
│   └── ...
├── final_project.py
└── final_exam.yaml
```

## How to Use This

1. **Pick a course** - Start with `course0/` to get started from ground zero
2. **Open an exercise** - Each exercise file has instructions in comments at the top
3. **Write code** - Follow the instructions and run your file to see results
4. **Play around** - Tweak it, break it, experiment. That's the point.
5. **Move on** - When you feel solid, hit the next exercise

**Quizzes and exams** are YAML files with questions. They're for self-reflection, not grading. Answer them honestly or skip them entirely.

**Final projects** tie everything together. Build something real.

## The Spirit

This is a sandbox. No one's grading you. Each exercise is minimal on purpose - the real learning happens when you mess around with the code, see what breaks, and figure out why. Run your code early and often. Make mistakes. That's how you learn.
