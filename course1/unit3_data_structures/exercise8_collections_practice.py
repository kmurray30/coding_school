# Build a friends organizer using a dictionary of lists

# Create a dictionary where:
# - Keys are activity names (like "gaming", "sports", "coding", etc.)
# - Values are lists of friend names who like that activity

# Start with an empty dictionary
# Add at least 3 different activities
# Each activity should have at least 2 friends in it
# Some friends can appear in multiple activities (we all have that one friend who does everything)

# Print the dictionary to see your friend groups
# Print just the friends who like one specific activity

...

# Expected output (yours will be different):
# {'gaming': ['Alex', 'Jordan'], 'sports': ['Sam', 'Jordan', 'Casey'], 'coding': ['Alex', 'Taylor']}
# ['Alex', 'Jordan']
