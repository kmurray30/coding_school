# Practice combining what you've learned about data structures

# Create a list of your favorite foods
favorite_foods = ...

# Add one more food to the list
...

# Print the first and last items
print(...)
print(...)

# Create a dictionary about yourself
my_info = {
    ...
}

# Add a new key "hobby" with your hobby
...

# Print your name from the dictionary
print(...)

# Create a tuple of three numbers
numbers = ...

# Print the middle number
print(...)

# Create a variable to track if you're done (set to None for now)
status = ...
print(status)

# Expected output (will vary based on your data):
# (your first food)
# (your last food)
# (your name)
# (your middle number)
# None
