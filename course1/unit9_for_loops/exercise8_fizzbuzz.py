# FizzBuzz - classic programming challenge.
# Loop through numbers 1 to n.
# For each number:
#   - If divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz"
#   - Else if divisible by 3, print "Fizz"
#   - Else if divisible by 5, print "Buzz"
#   - Otherwise, print the number

# DEBUGGING TIP:
# This is a perfect exercise to practice your debugging skills from Unit 7!
# If your output doesn't match the expected results:
# 1. Add print statements to see the value of each number and the conditions
# 2. Use the VS Code debugger to step through the loop and watch the branching logic
# 3. Set a breakpoint inside the loop and use Continue (F5) to check specific numbers

# Create a function that takes a number n and prints the FizzBuzz sequence up to n
