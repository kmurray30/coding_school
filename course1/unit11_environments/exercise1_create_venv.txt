Create a virtual environment using Python's venv module.

Run this command in your terminal:

python3 -m venv myenv

This creates a folder called 'myenv' containing an isolated Python environment.

Verify it worked by checking that a 'myenv' folder exists in your current directory.

Note: it is common practice for the environment folder to be called '.venv' (the . makes it hidden). We will use myenv though.
