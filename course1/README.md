# Course 1: Intro to Coding (Python)

Learn to write small programs with control flow, functions, and proper dependency management. Go from "I can run a file" to "I can build useful programs."

**For detailed course outline and exercise descriptions, see:** [../plans/course1/course-outline.md](../plans/course1/course-outline.md)

**Estimated Total Time:** 7h

## Prerequisites

**Required:** Course 0 (Developer Bearings) - Terminal navigation, VSCode basics, running Python files

You should be comfortable with:
- Navigating filesystem using `cd`, `ls`, `pwd`
- Creating and editing `.py` files in VSCode
- Running Python files from terminal and VSCode
- Reading basic syntax errors

## Course Units

### Unit 1: Output + Basic Programs (30 min)
8 exercises teaching output, variables, and user input. Learn that code runs top-to-bottom and results can be stored.

### Unit 2: Primitive Types + Strings (30 min)
11 exercises teaching Python's basic types: strings, integers, floats, and booleans. Master type conversion, string concatenation, and string operations.

### Unit 3: Data Structures (30 min)
8 exercises teaching lists, dictionaries, tuples, and None. Learn to create, access, and modify collections of data.

### Unit 4: Functions (Using and Creating) (30 min)
8 exercises teaching built-in functions and creating your own. Learn parameters, return values, and function composition.

### Unit 5: Imports and Libraries (30 min)
7 exercises teaching how to import and use Python modules. Explore the standard library (math, random, datetime).

### Unit 6: Branching (30 min)
9 exercises teaching boolean logic, operator precedence, and conditional statements. Make programs respond differently based on conditions.

### Unit 7: Loops - While (30 min)
9 exercises teaching while loops, exception handling, and control flow. Master break, continue, try/except, and the accumulator pattern.

### Unit 8: Debugging (30 min)
9 exercises teaching print debugging and VS Code debugger. Learn to set breakpoints, step through code, and inspect variables. Master debugging techniques for branching and loops.

### Unit 9: Loops - For (30 min)
9 exercises teaching for loops and range(). Master iteration over sequences and nested loops. Apply debugging skills from Unit 8.

### Unit 10: Scope (30 min)
8 exercises teaching local vs global scope. Learn why globals are bad and how to write cleaner functions.

### Unit 11: Mutability vs Immutability (30 min)
9 exercises teaching the difference between mutable and immutable types. Avoid common reference bugs.

### Unit 12: Python Environments and Dependencies (30 min)
8 exercises teaching virtual environments, pip, and requirements.txt. Install and use third-party packages.

### Final Project (60 min)
Creative capstone project combining all course concepts. Build a personal tracker with menu system, data storage, stats calculation, and user input validation.

## How to Use

1. Work through units in order (they build on each other)
2. Complete exercises sequentially within each unit
3. Run your code and compare output to expected results
4. At end of each unit, run graders (see unit README for instructions)
5. Take quiz (quiz.yaml) for self-reflection after each unit
6. Build the final project (final_project.py) - your capstone achievement
7. Take final exam (final_exam.yaml) after completing all units
8. Use cheat sheet (cheat-sheet.yaml) as reference when you forget syntax

## Tips

- Don't rush. Learning happens through iteration.
- If you get stuck, read the error message carefully.
- Run your code often - don't wait until everything is "perfect."
- The exercises are minimal on purpose. Learn by doing, not reading.
- Compare your output to the expected output in comments.
- Graders are for validation, not your primary feedback. You should know if you succeeded before running the grader.
