# Unit 2: Primitive Types + Strings

Learn about Python's basic types: strings, integers, floats, and booleans. Practice type conversion and string operations including concatenation.

**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes

## How to Validate

At the end of the unit, run the graders to check your work:

```bash
python graders/unit_grader.py
python graders/project_grader.py
```

Take the quiz (`quiz.yaml`) for self-reflection.
