# String concatenation is like assembly. Snap pieces together with +

first_name = "Bobo"
last_name = "san"
full_name = first_name + last_name
print(full_name)

# Build your own combined string
...

# Bonus: try concatenating a space between the first and last name

# Expected output:
# Bobosan
# (your combined string)
