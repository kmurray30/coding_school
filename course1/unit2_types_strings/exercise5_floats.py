# Floats are decimal numbers

price = 19.99
tax_rate = 0.08

total = price * tax_rate
print(total)

# Pt1. Create your own float calculation
...

# Pt2. Try creating two int variables (no decimals) and dividing them to get a decimal number. Confirm the type of the result.

# Expected output:
# 1.5992
# (your result from pt1)
# (your results from pt2)
