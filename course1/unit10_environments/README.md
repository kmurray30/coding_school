# Unit 10: Python Environments and Dependencies

Learn to manage Python dependencies with virtual environments, pip, and requirements.txt. Practice with third-party libraries.

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours

## How to Validate

This unit involves package installation and network requests, so auto-grading is limited.

Validate by:
1. Running each exercise and verifying it works
2. Checking that packages install successfully
3. Ensuring the mini project fetches and displays data correctly

Take the quiz (`quiz.yaml`) for self-reflection.

## Note

Exercises 1-3 and 6 are .txt files with terminal commands, not Python code.
Exercises 4, 5, 7, 8 are Python files that require packages to be installed first.
