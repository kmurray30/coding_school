VS Code Debugger - Introduction
================================

The VS Code debugger lets you pause your program and inspect everything.

KEY FEATURES:

1. BREAKPOINTS
   - Click in the left margin (gutter) next to a line number
   - A red dot appears
   - Program pauses RIGHT BEFORE executing that line
   - Click again to remove

2. DEBUG CONTROLS (top of screen when debugging)
   - Continue (F5): Run until next breakpoint
   - Step Over (F10): Execute current line, move to next
   - Step Into (F11): Jump into function being called
   - Step Out (Shift+F11): Finish current function
   - Stop (Shift+F5): End debugging

3. VARIABLES PANEL (left sidebar)
   - Shows all variables in current scope
   - Shows their current values
   - Values that changed are highlighted

4. CALL STACK (left sidebar)
   - Shows which functions called which
   - Click to see different scopes

HOW TO START DEBUGGING:

Method 1: Press F5, select "Python Debugger"
Method 2: Right-click in editor -> "Debug Python File"
Method 3: Click "Run and Debug" header in left sidebar

STEP OVER vs STEP INTO:

Step Over (F10):
- Executes the whole line (including function calls)
- Use this most of the time
- Good when you trust the function

Step Into (F11):
- Jumps INSIDE function calls
- Use when you want to see what happens inside
- Good for debugging your own functions

You'll practice these in the next exercises.
