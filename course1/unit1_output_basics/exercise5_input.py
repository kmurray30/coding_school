# input() lets you ask the user for information

print("What is your name?")
name = input() # note: this makes the terminal wait for user input followed by enter, then assigns that input to the variable 'name'
print(name)

# Expected output:
# What is your name?
# (wait for user to type their name)
# (prints whatever they typed)
