# Unit 1: Output + Basic Programs

Learn to print output, store values in variables, and get user input. Code runs top-to-bottom.

**Estimated Time:** 20 minutes

## How to Validate

Most exercises in this unit use `input()`, so auto-grading is limited. Validate by running your code and comparing output to what's expected in the comments.

For exercises that can be auto-graded:

```bash
python graders/unit_grader.py
```

Take the quiz (`quiz.yaml`) for self-reflection.
