# Syntax errors happen when you break Python's rules.
# Uncomment each line one at a time and run the program to see different errors.

# print("Missing closing quote)
# print(No quotes at all)
# print "Missing parentheses"

# Fix this line (missing closing quote):
print("Fix me!)

# Expected output (when fixed): Fix me!
