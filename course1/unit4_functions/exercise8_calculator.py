# Build a calculator program.
# Define four functions: add, subtract, multiply, divide.
# Each function takes two parameters and returns the result.
# Ask the user for two numbers
# Return the resutls of the four operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide) for the two numbers
# Hint: you can print and concatenate characters like '+' or '-' like you would any other string. For example, print("1" + " - " + "2") would display "1 - 2".

# Expected output:
# Enter first number:
# (user types number)
# Enter second number:
# (user types number)
# (number1) + (number2) = (calculated result)
# (number1) - (number2) = (calculated result)
# (number1) * (number2) = (calculated result)
# (number1) / (number2) = (calculated result)
