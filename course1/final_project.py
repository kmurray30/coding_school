# Build a personal tracker terminal application for something you care about.
# 
# Track any kind of data over time - workouts, study sessions, gaming scores,
# reading pages, coffee consumption, whatever interests you.
#
# Your tracker should:
# - Let users add new entries (ask for relevant info, store it)
# - Show their history (display past entries in a readable format)
# - Calculate some stats (averages, totals, streaks, personal bests, etc.)
# - Use a menu system so users can choose what to do
# - Keep running until the user chooses to quit
# - Handle bad input gracefully (don't crash if they type nonsense)
# - Include timestamps so you know when things happened
# - Add some personality (random encouraging messages, fun formatting, etc.)
#
# Organize your code with functions - don't dump everything in one giant block.
#
# BONUS CHALLENGES (optional):
# - Use a third-party package to make it prettier (colorama, rich, etc.)
# - Save data to a file so it persists between runs
# - Track multiple different things in one program
# - Add data visualization (simple text-based charts/graphs)
#
# Example interaction (yours can be different, though feel free to build this):
