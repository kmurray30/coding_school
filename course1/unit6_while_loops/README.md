# Unit 6: Loops - While

Learn while loops to repeat code until a condition changes. Master break, continue, and the accumulator pattern.

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours

## How to Validate

At the end of the unit, run the graders to check your work:

```bash
python graders/unit_grader.py
python graders/project_grader.py
```

Take the quiz (`quiz.yaml`) for self-reflection.
