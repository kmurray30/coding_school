# Keep asking until user provides a valid number (eg 1 is valid, one is not)
# hint 1: the simplest way to check if a string is a number is to try to cast it to an int
# hint 2: if the cast fails, a ValueError will be raised. How can you use this to your advantage? (hint 3 way over here -->                                                  use a try/except block to catch the ValueError)

# Expected output:
# Enter a number:
# (user types invalid input)
# That's not a number. Try again.
# Enter a number:
# (user types valid number)
# Valid! (number) is a number.
