# Build a number guessing game.
# Generate a random number between 1 and 100.
# Keep asking the user for guesses until they get it right.
# After each wrong guess, tell them if the answer is higher or lower.
# Count how many attempts it takes.
# When they guess correctly, congratulate them and tell them how many attempts they took.
# Bonus: See if you can write it with break/continue, and then without them (without break/continue is usually better practice)

# Expected output:
# I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100
# What's your guess?
# (user guesses)
# Higher! (or Lower!)
# What's your guess?
# (user guesses again)
# ...
# Correct! You got it in (number) attempts!
