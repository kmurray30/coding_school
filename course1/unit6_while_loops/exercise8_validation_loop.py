# Keep asking until user provides a valid number (eg 1 is valid, one is not)
# Hint: Combine a while loop with try/except to keep asking until they provide valid input

...

# Expected output:
# Enter a number:
# (user types invalid input)
# That's not a number. Try again.
# Enter a number:
# (user types valid number)
# Valid! (number) is a number.
