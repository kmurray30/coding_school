# Build an age validator that categorizes people by age.
# Ask the user for their age.
# Handle the case where they don't enter a valid number.
# Check their age and print the appropriate category:
#   - Negative numbers: "Invalid age"
#   - Under 13: "You are a child"
#   - 13-17: "You are a teenager"
#   - 18-64: "You are an adult"
#   - 65+: "You are a senior"

# Expected output:
# What is your age?
# (user enters age)
# You are a (category)
# 
# OR if invalid input:
# That's not a valid number
