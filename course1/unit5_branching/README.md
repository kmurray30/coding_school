# Unit 5: Branching

Learn boolean logic and conditional statements. Make your programs respond differently based on conditions.

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours

## How to Validate

At the end of the unit, run the graders to check your work:

```bash
python graders/unit_grader.py
python graders/project_grader.py
```

Take the quiz (`quiz.yaml`) for self-reflection.
