## Course 0 — Developer Bearings: Terminal + VSCode + Git (no “real CS” yet)

Goal: feel comfortable navigating a codebase and running code before you learn concepts.

### Unit 0 — Terminal/CLI *(Language: Shell/CLI)*

- Terminal navigation: `pwd`, `ls`, `cd`
- Relative vs absolute paths
- More terminal commands: `touch`, `mkdir`, `cp`

### Unit 1 - VSCode essentials *(Language: VSCode + Shell/CLI)*
- Creating/editing files in VSCode (no fancy extensions yet—just open folder, edit, save)
- Running code from the VS terminal (the idea of “current directory” + “run this file”)
- Reading program output in the terminal (so “Printing” later makes sense)

### Unit 2 — Creating Python files *(Language: Python + Shell/CLI)*

- Creating `.py` files
- Running a Python file from the VSCode CLI vs running inside the editor
