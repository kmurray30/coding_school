## Course 1 — Intro to Coding (Python)

Goal: go from "I can run a file" → "I can write small programs with control flow and functions."

### Unit 1 — Output + basic programs *(Language: Python)*

- Printing
- Sequentiality (your code runs top-to-bottom; you can *store results in variables* and pass them to later steps)

### Unit 2 — Primitive types + strings *(Language: Python)*

- Primitive types (numbers, booleans, strings—just enough to proceed)
- String concat (build strings from pieces)

### Unit 3 — Functions (using and creating) *(Language: Python)*

- Using functions from a library (e.g., "lowercasing" a string)
- Creating your own functions (inputs → outputs)
- "Functions within functions" vs "assign then pass" (same idea, different readability tradeoffs)

### Unit 4 — Imports and libraries *(Language: Python)*

- Importing libraries (what an import *means* at a practical level)

### Unit 5 — Branching *(Language: Python)*

- If statements (how programs make decisions)

### Unit 6 — Loops: while *(Language: Python)*

- While loops (repeat until a condition changes)

### Unit 7 — Debugging *(Language: Python + VS Code)*

- Print debugging (using print statements to trace program execution)
- VS Code debugger (breakpoints, step over, step into, continue)
- Variables panel and call stack
- Debugging branching logic and loops
- When to use print debugging vs VS Code debugger

### Unit 8 — Loops: for *(Language: Python)*

- For loops (repeat across a sequence of items)
- Using debugging techniques to understand loop behavior

### Unit 9 — Scope *(Language: Python)*

- Scope (what names are visible where; why "where you define something" matters)

### Unit 10 — Mutability vs immutability *(Language: Python)*

- Immutability vs mutability (when "changing something" mutates an object vs creates a new one)

### Unit 11 — Python environments and dependencies *(Language: Python + Shell/CLI)*

- Virtual environments (`venv`) — isolate dependencies per project
- `pip install` — installing external packages
- `requirements.txt` — sharing/reproducing environments
- Example libraries for practice: `requests` (HTTP requests), `colorama` (terminal colors), `faker` (generating test data), `pillow` (basic image manipulation)
