# Lastly, we're going to learn about booleans.
# Booleans a type whose value is only either True or False.
my_boolean = True

# It's an extremely useful type as you will see in the next unit.

# For now, we will simply set values to True or False.

# For this exercise, see if you can create a boolean variable with the value False, and print both
#   the value and the type of the variable.

...


# Expected output:
# False
# <class 'bool'>
