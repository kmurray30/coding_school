# Putting it all together, let's create a program where you:
# 
# 1. Ask the user to input a valid int,
#   a. Cast it to an int (since all inputs are strings by default)
#   b. Print the type of the variable after casting (should be <class 'int'>)
# 2. Ask the user to input a valid float,
#   a. Cast it to a float (since all inputs are strings by default)
#   b. Print the type of the variable after casting (should be <class 'float'>)
# 3. Ask the user to input a valid boolean,
#   a. Cast it to a boolean (since all inputs are strings by default)
#   b. Print the type of the variable after casting (should be <class 'bool'>)

...

# Expected output:
# Input a valid int:
# (wait for user input. Make sure to input a valid int, otherwise the program will error)
# <class 'int'>
# Input a valid float:
# (wait for user input. Make sure to input a valid float, otherwise the program will error)
# <class 'float'>
# Input a valid boolean:
# (wait for user input. Make sure to input a valid boolean, otherwise the program will error)
# <class 'bool'>

# Congrats! You've completed the unit! Feel free to play around with your code. For example,
# see what happens when you input an invalid type. Or see what happens when you cast an int to a boolean or vise versa.
