# Let's see what happens when you try to convert a float to an int.
#   Do you think it will work? What do you think the output will be?
my_float = 2.5
my_int = int(my_float)
print(my_int)

# Expected output: ???















# READ ONLY AFTER RUNNING THIS CODE
# --------------------------------
# This will work, but it will round down to the nearest whole number.
# So 2.5 will become 2.
# Casting a float to an int will always round down.
