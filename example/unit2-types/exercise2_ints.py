# The next type we will learn about is the int type.
# Ints are whole numbers, like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc.
# In python (and most programming languages) we can operate on ints using the +, -, *, /, % operators.

# For this exercise, I will show you an example usage of ints, and you will try to guess the outputs before running.

a = 2
b = 4

print(a + b)
print(a - b)
print(a * b)
print(b / a)
print(b % a) # modulo is the remainder of the division of b by a

# Expected output: ???
