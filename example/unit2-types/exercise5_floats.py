# Remember from math class that integers can only be whole numbers.
# So then what happens when you try to divide 5 by 2 using ints?
my_num = 5 / 2
print(my_num)

# You'll notice that the output is 2.5. But then what type is this? Let's find out :)
# Use the function from the previous exercises to find the type of my_num.

...

# Expected output:
# 2.5
# <class '???'>
