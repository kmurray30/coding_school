# Now let's learn about casting. This is the process of converting one type to another.
# For example, we can convert a string to an int by using the int() function.
# Note this ONLY works if the string is a valid int.

# Predict the output of the following code before running it.

my_string = "5"
my_num = int(my_string)
print(my_string)
print(my_num)

print(type(my_string))
print(type(my_num))

# Expected output: ??? (predict 4 lines of output)
