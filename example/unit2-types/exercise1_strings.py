# In this unit we are going to learn about the different types of variables in Python.
# So far we've been using strings, which are sequences of characters.
example_string = "Hello World"

# We can also use single quotes to define strings.
example_string = 'Hello World'

# As you saw, we can concatenate (combine) strings by using the + operator.
# And there are also functions like len() which act on strings.

# To refresh, simply print "Hello World" by concatenating the strings "Hello" and "World" (try using single quotes for one and double quotes for the other)

...

# Expected output: Hello World
