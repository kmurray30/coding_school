# Now that we know about booleans, let's learn how to create them using comparisons.
# We can compare values using comparison operators:
#   == (equal to)
#   != (not equal to)
#   > (greater than)
#   < (less than)
#   >= (greater than or equal to)
#   <= (less than or equal to)

# These comparisons return True or False (booleans).

# Predict the output of the following code:
print(5 == 5)
print(5 != 5)
print(5 > 3)
print(3 > 5)
print(5 >= 5)
print(3 <= 5)

# Expected output: ??? (6 lines of True/False)
