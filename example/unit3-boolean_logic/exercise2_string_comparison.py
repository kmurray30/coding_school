# You can also compare strings! Let's see how this works.

# Predict the output:
print("hello" == "hello")
print("hello" == "Hello")
print("abc" < "def")  # This compares alphabetically
print("apple" > "banana")

# NOTE: Comment the above code once you've run it

# Now create two variables with your name and a friend's name.
# Use comparison operators to check the following:
# 1. Are they equal?
# 2. Does your name come first alphabetically?

my_name = "..."
friend_name = "..."

...

# Expected output:
# 1. False
# 2. ???
