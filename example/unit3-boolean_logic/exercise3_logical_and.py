# Now let's learn about logical operators. These combine boolean values.
# The 'and' operator returns True only if BOTH conditions are True.

# Examples:
print(True and True)    # True
print(True and False)   # False
print(False and True)   # False
print(False and False)  # False

# NOTE: Comment the above code once you've run it

# You can combine comparisons with 'and':
age = 25
print(age >= 18 and age <= 65)  # Is age between 18 and 65?

# Your turn: Create a program that checks if a number is between 10 and 20 (inclusive).
# Ask the user for a number, then print True if it's in range, False otherwise.

...

# Expected output:
# Input a number:
# (wait for input)
# Number is between 10 and 20: (True/False depending on input)
