# The 'or' operator returns True if AT LEAST ONE condition is True.

# Examples:
print(True or True)    # True
print(True or False)   # True
print(False or True)   # True
print(False or False)  # False

# NOTE: Comment the above code once you've run it

# You can use 'or' to check multiple conditions:
weather = "sunny"
print(weather == "sunny" or weather == "cloudy")  # Good weather for a walk?

# Your turn: Ask the user for their favorite color.
# Print True if it's "red", "blue", or "green". Print False otherwise.

...

# Expected output:
# Input a color:
# (wait for input)
# your color was red, blue, or green: (True/False depending on input)
