# What if we want to run different code when the condition is False?
# We use 'else'!

temperature = 75
if temperature > 80:
    print("It's hot outside!")
else:
    print("It's not that hot.")

# The 'else' block runs when the 'if' condition is False.

# NOTE: Comment the above code once you've run it

# Your turn: Ask the user for a number.
# If it's positive, print "Positive number!"
# Otherwise, print "Not positive!"

...

# Expected output:
# Enter a number:
# (wait for input)
# Positive number! OR Not positive!
