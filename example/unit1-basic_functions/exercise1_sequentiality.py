# Before going further, it's important we stop and understand sequentiality.
# Sequentiality is the order in which code is executed.
# In Python, code is executed from top to bottom, line by line.
# This is important to understand because it means that the order of your code matters.

# For this exercise, simply see if you can predict the output of the following code.
# No need to edit this file.

# Note: the value of a variable can be changed.

first = "one"
second = "two"
print(first)
first = "three"
print(first)
print(second)

# Expected output: ???
