# FYI, the values in quotes that we've been using are called "strings".
# More on these in the next unit.

# For this exercise, we will work on combining strings.
# We can combine strings by using the + operator.
# What do you think this will output?
first = "sup " # notice the space after the sup
second = "dog"
combined = first + second
print(combined)

# Expected output: ???
