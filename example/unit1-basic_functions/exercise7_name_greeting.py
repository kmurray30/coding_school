# Now to put it all together, let's refine the final program from unit 0.

# Write a program to ask the user for their name, and then print a greeting to them in a single line.
# Convert the name to uppercase.
# Then tell them how long their name is.

...

# Expected output:
# Type your name
# (wait for user input)
# Hello <NAME>!
# Your name is <length of name> letters long.
