# Notice nothing really happened, and what you typed didn't really matter. This is because
#   we need to do something with that input by assigning it to a variable, just like we did with "Hello World".

# Now let's try this again, but this time assigning the input to a variable.
# Your goal: print the value back to the user.

user_input = input()

# Expected output: (whatever you typed)
