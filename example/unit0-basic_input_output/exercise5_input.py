# Great job so far! The last thing we're going to learn is how to take user input.
# We can use the input() function to take user input.

# When you run the following code, the program in the terminal will wait for you to type
#   something and press enter. The program will "hang" (or not continue to completion) until you do so.

# Go ahead and try it out.
input()

# Expected output: (nothing, but make sure the program completes)
