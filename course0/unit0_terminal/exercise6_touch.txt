# Exercise 6: touch (Create Empty Files)

Create empty files using touch.

What to do:
1. Make sure you're in my_first_project (from exercise 5)
2. Type: touch file1.txt
3. Type: touch file2.txt
4. Type: touch file3.txt
5. Type: ls (to see all three files)

Expected output: Three files listed: file1.txt, file2.txt, file3.txt

Note: touch creates empty files. You can also use it to update the "last modified" timestamp of existing files.
