# Exercise 5: mkdir (Create a Directory)

Create new folders using mkdir (make directory).

What to do:
1. Navigate to a place you want to create a folder (maybe Desktop or home directory)
2. Type: mkdir my_first_project
3. Type: ls (to see your new folder)
4. Type: cd my_first_project (hint: you should be able to use tab-complete for folder/file names)
5. Type: pwd (to verify you're inside)

Expected behavior: New directory created, you successfully navigated into it.
