# Exercise 8: Terminal Project (Putting It All Together)

Create a proper project structure like a real developer.

What to do:
1. Navigate to a location where you want to work (Desktop or home is fine)
2. Create a directory called my_app
3. Navigate into my_app
4. Create three subdirectories within my_app: src, tests, docs
5. Create a file called README.txt in the my_app directory (not in subdirectories)
6. Navigate into src using a relative path
7. Navigate back to my_app without using the absoluate path
8. Navigate into src using an absolute path (like /Users/yourname/etc)
9. List the contents of my_app from within the src directory

Expected final structure:
my_app/
├── README.txt
├── src/
├── tests/
└── docs/

Verification:
- From within my_app, run ls and you should see: README.txt, docs, src, tests
- Run pwd and you should see the full path to my_app

You've now got developer bearings. You can navigate a filesystem, create directories, create files, and understand where you are at all times. That's 90% of what you need.
