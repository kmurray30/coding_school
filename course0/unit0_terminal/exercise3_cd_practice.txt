# Exercise 3: cd Practice (Moving Around)

Navigate between directories using cd (change directory).

What to do:
1. Type: cd ~
2. Type: pwd (to verify where you are)
3. Type: cd Desktop (to go to your Desktop folder, if you have one)
4. Type: pwd (to see you've moved)
5. Type: cd .. (moves a directory up)
6. Type: pwd (to verify)

Expected behavior: You successfully moved between directories and verified with pwd

Note: ~ is a shortcut for your home directory. .. means "parent directory."
