# Exercise 4: Absolute vs Relative Paths

Two ways to specify a location - absolute (full path from root) or relative (from where you are now).

Absolute path: Starts from the root /
- Example: /Users/yourname/Desktop
- Works from anywhere

Relative path: Starts from current directory
- . refers to the current directory you are in
- .. refers to the directory above the one you are in
- Example: Desktop/folder (relevant if you're in your home directory with Desktop as a directory within)
- Example: ../otherfolder (go up one level, then into otherfolder)

What to do:
1. Type: cd ~ (go home)
2. Type: cd Desktop (relative - only works if you're in home) (hint: `cd ./Desktop` works the same here)
3. Type: cd /Users/yourname (replace yourname with your actual username - absolute, works from anywhere)
4. Type: cd .. (moves one level up)
5. Navigate around using both styles. Use pwd frequently to see where you are.

Expected behavior: You understand that absolute paths work from anywhere, relative paths depend on your current location.
