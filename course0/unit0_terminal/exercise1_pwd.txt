# Exercise 1: pwd (Where Am I?)

Every terminal session has a "current directory" - where you are in the file system right now.

What to do:
1. Open your terminal
2. Type: pwd
3. Press Enter

Expected output: You'll see a path like /Users/yourname or /home/yourname

This is where you are. pwd stands for "print working directory."
