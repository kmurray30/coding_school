# Exercise 7: cp (Copy Files)

Copy files using cp (copy).

What to do:
1. Make sure you're in my_first_project with your three files
2. Type: cp file1.txt file1_backup.txt
3. Type: ls

Expected output: You should see file1.txt, file1_backup.txt, file2.txt, file3.txt

Note: Format is cp source destination. The original file stays, and a copy is created.
