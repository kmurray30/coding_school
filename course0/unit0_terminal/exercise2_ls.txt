# Exercise 2: ls (What's Here?)

List the files and folders in your current directory.

What to do:
1. Type: ls
2. Press Enter

Expected output: A list of files and folders in your current location

If you see nothing, that's fine - your current directory might be empty.

Bonus: Try ls -la to see ALL files including hidden ones (files starting with .)
