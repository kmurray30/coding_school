# Course 0: Developer Bearings

**Learn terminal navigation, VSCode, and how to run Python files before diving into programming concepts.**

This course is about getting comfortable with the tools you'll use every day as a developer. You'll learn to navigate your computer using the terminal, use VSCode to create and edit files, and run Python code. No programming knowledge required.

**For detailed course outline and exercise descriptions, see:** [plans/course0/course-outline.md](../plans/course0/course-outline.md)

## Prerequisites

**None.** This is the absolute starting point.

You'll need:
- A computer with terminal access (Mac, Linux, or Windows with WSL/PowerShell)
- VSCode installed ([download here](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
- Python 3.x installed ([download here](https://www.python.org/downloads/))

Not sure if you have Python? Open a terminal and type `python3 --version`. If you see a version number (like `Python 3.11.0`), you're good.

## Course Units

### Unit 0: Terminal/CLI Fundamentals (10 min)
8 exercises teaching terminal navigation: pwd, ls, cd, mkdir, touch, cp.

### Unit 1: VSCode Essentials (15 min)
7 exercises teaching VSCode workflow: opening folders, creating files, using the integrated terminal.

### Unit 2: Running Python (20 min)
8 Python exercises teaching how to create .py files, run them, and read errors.

### Final Exam (10 min)

**Estimated Total Time:** 55 min

## Getting Help

**Terminal commands not working?**
- Make sure you're in the right directory (`pwd` to check)
- Check for typos (the terminal is case-sensitive)
- Read error messages - they tell you what's wrong

**VSCode issues?**
- Make sure you opened a folder, not just individual files
- Save your files before running (look for the white dot on tabs)
- Check that VSCode's terminal is in the right directory

**Python not running?**
- Make sure you saved the file
- Check you're in the correct directory (`pwd`)
- Verify Python is installed (`python3 --version`)
- Read error messages carefully

**Still stuck?** 
Read the error message again. Seriously. Error messages tell you exactly what's wrong. Learn to read them.

## How to Use

1. Work through exercises in order
2. Run your code and compare to expected output
3. At end of each unit, see that unit's README for grader instructions
4. Take quiz (quiz.yaml) for self-reflection after each unit
5. Take final exam (final_exam.yaml) after completing all units
