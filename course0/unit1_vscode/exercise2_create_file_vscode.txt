# Exercise 2: Create File in VSCode

You can create files using VSCode's GUI instead of the terminal.

What to do:
1. Make sure my_app is open in VSCode
2. Right-click in the Explorer sidebar
3. Select "New File"
4. Name it hello.txt
5. Type some text: "This file was created in VSCode"
6. Save it with Cmd+S (Mac) or Ctrl+S (Windows/Linux)

Expected result: hello.txt appears in your file explorer with your text inside.

Note: Notice the dot on the file tab when unsaved. That dot = unsaved changes.
