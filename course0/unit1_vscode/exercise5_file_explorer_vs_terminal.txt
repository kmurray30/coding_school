# Exercise 5: File Explorer vs Terminal (Two Ways, Same Result)

Creating files in VSCode or the terminal does the same thing. They both modify the file system.

What to do:
1. Create a file using VSCode: Right-click → New File → name it vscode_file.txt
2. Create a file using terminal: In VSCode's terminal, type touch terminal_file.txt
3. Type ls in the terminal
4. Look at VSCode's Explorer

Expected result: Both vscode_file.txt and terminal_file.txt appear in BOTH the terminal output AND the VSCode Explorer.

Key insight: VSCode and terminal are both looking at the same file system. They're two views of the same thing.
