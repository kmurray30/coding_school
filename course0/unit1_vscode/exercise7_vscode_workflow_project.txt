# Exercise 7: VSCode Workflow Project (Quick File Switching)

Working with multiple files efficiently.

What to do:
1. Create a new folder on your Desktop or home directory called simple_website
2. Open that folder in VSCode (File → Open Folder)
3. Create three files using VSCode:
   - index.html
   - style.css
   - script.js
4. Open index.html and add this comment: <!-- This is the homepage -->
5. Open style.css and add this comment: /* Styles go here */
6. Open script.js and add this comment: // JavaScript code goes here
7. Save all three files
8. Practice switching between them:
   - Click tabs at the top to switch
   - Press Cmd+P (Mac) or Ctrl+P (Windows/Linux) to open the Quick File Switcher
   - Type the filename and press Enter

Expected result: Three files exist, each with one comment line. You can quickly switch between them.

Pro tip: Cmd+P / Ctrl+P is one of the most useful shortcuts in VSCode. Learn it now.

Verification structure:
simple_website/

├── style.css       (contains: /* Styles go here */)
└── script.js       (contains: // JavaScript code goes here)
