# Exercise 3: VSCode Terminal (It's All Connected)

VSCode has a built-in terminal. It's just a regular terminal that starts in your opened folder.

What to do:
1. With my_app still open, go to View → Terminal (or press Ctrl+` or Cmd+`)
2. A terminal panel opens at the bottom
3. Type: pwd
4. Press Enter
5. Type: ls
6. Press Enter

Expected output:
- pwd shows the path to my_app
- ls shows the same files you see in VSCode's explorer

Note: VSCode's terminal isn't special. It's just convenient - it automatically starts in your project folder.
