# Exercise 4: Edit and Save Workflow

The basic workflow - open, edit, notice unsaved indicator, save.

What to do:
1. Open hello.txt by clicking it in the Explorer
2. Add a new line: "This is a second line"
3. Notice the white dot on the file tab (means unsaved)
4. Save with Cmd+S (Mac) or Ctrl+S (Windows/Linux)
5. Notice the dot disappears

Expected result: File is saved, dot is gone.

Shortcut to memorize: Cmd+S or Ctrl+S. You'll use this 1000 times a day.
