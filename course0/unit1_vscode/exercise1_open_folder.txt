# Exercise 1: Open Folder (The Workspace Concept)

VSCode works with "folders" as workspaces. Opening a folder gives you access to all files inside it.

What to do:
1. Open VSCode
2. Click "File" → "Open Folder" (or "Open..." on Mac)
3. Navigate to the my_app directory you created in Unit 0
4. Click "Open"
5. Look at the left sidebar (Explorer) - you should see your folder structure

Expected result: You see my_app in the explorer with docs/, src/, tests/, and README.txt visible.

Note: Opening a folder makes VSCode "aware" of all files inside. This is how you work on projects.
