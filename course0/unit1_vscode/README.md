Learn the VSCode workflow: opening folders, creating files, using the integrated terminal, and navigating your workspace. This is how you'll work every day as a developer.

**Estimated Time:** 15 minutes

## How to Validate

These are hands-on VSCode exercises. You'll know you got it right when you can perform the tasks and see the expected results. No grader for this unit - just follow the instructions and verify you can do each task.

Take the quiz (`quiz.yaml`) for self-reflection.
