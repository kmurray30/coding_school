# Exercise 6: Navigate in VSCode

Moving around in VSCode using both the GUI and terminal.

What to do:
1. In VSCode Explorer, click on the src/ folder to expand it
2. Right-click src/ → New File → create main.py
3. In the terminal, type: cd src (to navigate into the src folder)
4. Type: pwd (to verify you're in src)
5. Type: ls (to see main.py)
6. Type: cd .. (to go back to my_app)
7. In VSCode, click main.py to open it

Expected result: You successfully navigated using both VSCode's GUI and the terminal. Both see the same files.

Note: You can navigate using whatever feels comfortable. Both work.
