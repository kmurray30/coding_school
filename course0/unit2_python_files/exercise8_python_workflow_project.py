# Multi-file Python project. Create three separate greeting files.

# Instructions:
# 1. Create a new folder called `greeting_app` within unit2_python_files/
# 2. Inside `greeting_app`, create three files:
#    - greeting1.py
#    - greeting2.py
#    - greeting3.py
#
# 3. In greeting1.py, write: print("Hello from file 1!")
# 4. In greeting2.py, write: print("Greetings from file 2!")
# 5. In greeting3.py, write: print("Salutations from file 3!")
#
# 6. Open a terminal and navigate to `greeting_app`
# 7. Run each file:
#    python3 greeting1.py
#    python3 greeting2.py
#    python3 greeting3.py
#
# 8. Verify each one prints its message

# Expected structure:
# greeting_app/
# ├── greeting1.py
# ├── greeting2.py
# └── greeting3.py

# Expected output when running greeting1.py: Hello from file 1!
# Expected output when running greeting2.py: Greetings from file 2!
# Expected output when running greeting3.py: Salutations from file 3!

# This is the workflow. Multiple files, each serving a purpose.
# You create, edit, save, and run. That's programming at the file level.

# Note: This exercise file is just instructions. 
# The actual work happens in the greeting_app folder you create.
