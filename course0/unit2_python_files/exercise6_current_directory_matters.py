# Your current directory matters when running Python files.
# Python looks for the file in your current directory.

print("If you see this, you're in the right directory!")

# Try this:
# 1. Navigate to this file's directory in terminal
# 2. Run: python3 exercise6_current_directory_matters.py
# 3. It works!
#
# 4. Navigate to the parent directory: cd ..
# 5. Try to run: python3 exercise6_current_directory_matters.py
# 6. Error! Python can't find the file.
#
# 7. Navigate back: cd unit2_python_files
# 8. Run it again - it works!

# Alternatively, use the full path: python3 unit2_python_files/exercise6_current_directory_matters.py

# Expected output: If you see this, you're in the right directory!
