# Unit 2: Running Python Files

Learn to create .py files, run them from the terminal and VSCode, modify code and re-run it, and read Python error messages. This is your first real coding workflow.

**Estimated Time:** 20 minutes

## How to Validate

At the end of the unit, run the graders to check your work:

```bash
python graders/unit_grader.py
python graders/project_grader.py
```

Take the quiz (`quiz.yaml`) for self-reflection.
