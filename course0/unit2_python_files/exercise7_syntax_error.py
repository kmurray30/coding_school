# Errors are feedback, not failure. Read them.

# This file has an intentional error. Run it and see what happens.
prin("This will cause an error")

# You'll see an error message. Read it carefully:
# - It tells you what went wrong: NameError: name 'prin' is not defined
# - It tells you which line: line X
# - It gives you a hint about the problem

# Fix the error by changing 'prin' to 'print', then run again.

# Expected output (after fixing): This will cause an error

# Note: The error message TELLS YOU what's wrong. Always read error messages.
# They're trying to help you.
